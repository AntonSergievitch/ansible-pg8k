## What is it?

Ansible modules for PostgreSQL - plain drop-in for your project.

## What is this for?

If you ever had to install psycopg2, you've definitely came across that dependency hell: libraries, libraries and libraries - tons of them. This project nulls out said dependency hassle: everything works out-of-the-box, you don't have to install anything. The guest star here is "pg8000": pure-Python PostgreSQL driver, with minor modifications to support its loading and usage by Ansible.

## Requirements

* CentOS/RHEL 7.x;
* Ansible >=2.9.x;
* Python >=3.6.x;
* PostgreSQL >=10.x (this was debugged with Postgres 12, though)

## Quick start guide

1. Copy to your project directory:
   1. playbooks/library/*
   2. playbooks/module_utils/pg8000/*
   3. playbooks/module_utils/scramp/*

2. You're done, please don't forget to perform a wild dance (well, latter was a joke, just in case :-)
